I've been using AI tools to help grow my one-woman business for the past year. Honestly, it's been a game-changer 
For example, with the help of AI, I was able to double my income last year without working more hours.





summarizer:


Here are the pertinent details : On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and 
I discovered that a trusted employee of ours ( our House Manager, 
who is the daughter of our now-former long-term Housekeeper ) 
had been stealing from us for the past 20 months. In addition to bank and check fraud,
stealing physical items and cash from our home, and identity fraud,
she and her family members were making unauthorized charges on two of our Chase Credit Cards
without our knowledge or permission. She was actively concealing XXXX XXXX XXXX of dollars
of fraudulent purchases by setting up fake Amazon accounts, XXXX accounts, etc.
and mirroring our household purchases in a way that made it very difficult to discover.
When we discovered the fraud, we went immediately to the XXXX XXXX Police Department ( XXXX ), 
and were fortunate enough to have a relationship with the Deputy Chief of Police 
who put us in touch with our local division 's fraud detectives.
Subsequently, given the complexity, scope, and dollar amount of the fraud,
the bulk of our financial case was assigned to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) of the XXXX.
Initially, we were instructed IN WRITING by the XXXX detectives handling
our case NOT to notify our insurance companies or financial institutions of the fraud 
until the XXXX had determined a final total loss amount given that they had to review over 1,000 pieces
of evidence of the fraud in the form of receipts, statements, texts admitting the fraud, etc.
